NPC1 (Young red-haired servant of Lacosa) : Has started a fire
“Hey friend, we barely made it away from the storm alive.”
“We need to get the heat going, but this fire wont do, we need some oil or something. Please go out and find a way to heat us up, or we’ll die of exposure before the undead finds us.”
*Must find either cans of oil for small reward, or turn on power station for heating for big reward, must have car battery to turn it on.*
Can of oil: ”Thank you, here take this light.*Takes hand and gives you light source.*”*Gets limited light.* “Amazing! *Gives you a big hug.* A working power station! If we could just get to harness that power, maybe we could settle here permanently. You have saved us thank you so much. *Hugs so tight you feel all warm, and places light source in belt.*”*Gets permanent light.*

*Chat
“Can’t you go out to get it” (I fell and hurt my foot, I wouldn’t be able to run)
“I will go get it” (We are counting on you not to turn into ice cycles.)
“Tell me again.” (You don’t feel it? It’s cold in here… please we need some oil to get this fire going, or some other way to heat us up.”
I have a can of oil ---^
I managed to turn on the power station---^
“Tell me about Lacosa…” (Lacosa? The flame, the fire. The one that brings warmth and life. You should join in a prayer sometime, we’ll burn your past away.*Smiles.*)
“You want to settle here?”*If managed to start power station.*(Those things are rare in working conditions! And this part of the wasteland needs an outpost to Lacosa, you almost feel like settling down already, maybe make a family here.” *Smiles.*)

End conversation – (Don’t let the chill of winter get to you, Lacosa’s light burns within you, I know it.)

“What do you mean get into position?”(Are you blind and deaf?! Didn’t you see how we were followed? I tell you, you young people take all things to easy these days, back in my day…*Goes on a rant.*) “Okay I get it”
“You think more weapons will make us safe…” (Of cause they will, we have a lot of ammo, easier to get your hands on than working weapons. Also even without ammo some will not date to fight a loaded gun.”
“But I will need the weapons myself?”(Don’t be stupid; what would you do running around with more guns than you can carry? If you hand them over I will give you some ammo in return and it will make the rest of us safe.) *Option to hand over weapons for ammo.*
“I want my gun back/get gun…” *Give back ammo.* (All right, take it, let the rest of us be set upon while your wasting time.)

“Can’t we just get out of here?”(The other’s wounds are to great, broken feet, cracked ribs, torn flesh. You would not just let them die would you? Nobody survives out there along for long without company, you have to be careful.)
