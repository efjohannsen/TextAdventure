Winter in the new world of Sunfall

The deathly chill clings to all it touches, banshee howls of wind blows across the rooftops, hail falling like meteors large enough to break a skull open, breaking the few remaining windows left in the townscape. You and your scavenger group have taken shelter from the harsh nuclear winter storms in a building, in a still standing town you have found across journey through the wasteland. Your group was recently set upon by the radioactive dead, zombies and ghouls, that roams the barren lands, you were one of two who managed to sustain no damage. 
You took upon this journey with your group to find useful scrap, with the winters being harsh as they are, most things lay low in the winter, which gives ample opportunities to scour the land from resources, but it seems you weren’t so lucky this time. Now you must manage to survive the hostilities in the wasteland.
