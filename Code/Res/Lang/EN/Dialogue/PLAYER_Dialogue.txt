I fell and hurt my foot, I wouldn't be able to run
I will go get it
I have a can of oil.
I managed to turn on the power station
Tell me about Solar Deity...
Tell me again.
What do you mean get into position?
Okay I get it.
You think more weapons will make us safe...?
I want my gun back.
But I will be needing the weapons myself
Tell me again.
Wouldn't it be smarter to use the sled parts?
Can you tell me about this battery?
How are our sleds doing?
Tell me again...
Can you heal me?
What can I do?
Anything else I can do?
Tell me again...
Can't we just get out of here?
Won't you need the gun?
How will you manage?
You look tired. Maybe you should go and rest?
Tell me again...
Why do we need to hold this position don't we want to leave?
Tell me again...
Why do we need to know?...
Tell me again...
Can't we just use the snow?
You want to settle here?
Tell me again...
Get well...
